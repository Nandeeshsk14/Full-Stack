#Secure Patient Medical Record Portal 

## Description
This project is a patient-centric web application designed to help individuals securely manage and share their medical records across hospitals while maintaining full ownership and privacy of their data.It features a dashboard with a chronological medical history timeline and relies on consent-based access control .Additionally, it includes an explicit, time-bound emergency access mode

## Core Features
* Patient Dashboard: A clean and trustworthy patient dashboardthat displays a chronological medical history timeline
* Data Privacy (Conceptual): The UI visually reflects encrypted data status and access permissions platform relies entirely on consent-based access control
* Interoperability Awareness: Simulates the process of importing medical records from different hospitals.
* Emergency Access:Provides an Emergency Access option for critical situations that is strictly time-bound

## Tech Stack
* HTML5:Page structure and layout.
* CSS3: Styling and visual feedback (e.g., color changes for emergency mode).
* Vanilla JavaScript:DOM manipulation, simulation of data decryption, and timer logic for emergency access.

## How to Run This Project
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
4. No server or database installation is required; the application runs entirely in the browser using mock data.

## What I Learned
* **Dynamic Frontend Logic:** I learned to use JavaScript arrays and loops to generate the medical timeline dynamically, rather than hardcoding HTML.
* **Visualizing Security:** I understood how to use UI cues—like lock icons and color changes—to visually represent encryption and build user trust.
* **Simulating Complex Features:** I learned to simulate backend concepts like "Emergency Access" and "Data Privacy" using simple boolean logic and timers (`setTimeout`).
